            I assume that by level 4 you mean engineers with roughly 2â€“5 years of experience, what I would call mid-level. I am a manager now, but as a senior engineer I enjoyed working with them a lot. There are several reasons. On one hand you can mostly delegate to them and they will deliver. On the other, you feel very useful, because as a good senior engineer you can contribute in unique ways that they can't yet, and you get to share your skills and experience with them. There's typically at least a bit of mentorship going on, and I personally enjoy that a lot.
